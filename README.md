# 🧬 THE ORPHANARIUM

A dynamic mutation engine that remixes assets and logic from abandoned creative projects into an ever-evolving art piece.

## 🎨 What is This?

The Orphanarium is not a portfolio. It is a creative system of recombination, mutation, and chaotic synthesis. It feeds on your unfinished projects and transforms them into something entirely new every 30-120 seconds.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the mutation engine
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to witness the chaos.

## 🔄 How It Works

The system operates in 4 phases that cycle randomly:

1. **CALM** - Minimal mutations, slow pace
2. **BUILD** - Increasing complexity and intensity 
3. **CHAOS** - Maximum mutation overload
4. **FADE** - Collapse back to fragments

### Current Mutations

- **BERLIN FEVER DREAM** - Pixel döner dealers invade 3D reality
- **VOICE BATTLE TALES** - Pitch-controlled combat dialogue generator
- **EXISTENTIAL PACKAGE SIMULATOR** - Find your ikigai through package delivery
- **TECHNO ZEN FUSION** - Berlin underground meets spiritual enlightenment
- **GLITCHED SITCOM FIGHTER** - TV characters break into fighting games
- **WILLY MULTIVERSE** - All Willy variants collide across dimensions
- **CHAT GRAFFITI GENERATOR** - Twitch chat becomes Berlin street art
- **DÖNER QUEST 3D** - Kebab-powered life simulation

## 🎮 Controls

- **🧬 RECOMBINE NOW** - Force instant mutation
- **Phase Indicator** - Shows current mutation phase
- Mutations change automatically every 30-120 seconds

## 🎯 Adding New Orphans

1. Add project assets to `/src/orphans/[project-name]/`
2. Update `AssetLibrary.js` with new asset references
3. Create new mutations in `RemixAlgorithms.js`
4. Watch your abandoned projects come to life

## 🌀 Philosophy

"Every unfinished project contains fragments of genius. The Orphanarium extracts these fragments and recombines them into something that was never meant to exist, yet somehow must."

**Note**: This system is designed to run indefinitely without breaking. The more orphan projects you feed it, the stronger and more unpredictable it becomes.
